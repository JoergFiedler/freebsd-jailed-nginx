    Notes
    -----

    The following files were created:
      - files/server.key
      - files/cert-bundle.pem
      - files/cachain.pem

    If you are using certificates issued by intermediate
    certificate authorities, this is how all those certs
    are chained together

    1) cachain
     > cat intermediate.ca > cachain.pem
    2) cert-bundle.pem
     > cat server.cert cachain.pem > cert-bundle.pem
